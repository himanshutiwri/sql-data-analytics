## Overview

This project assesses **vendor efficiency and retail inventory dynamics** to deliver actionable insights for purchasing, pricing, and inventory optimization.
It includes a **complete end-to-end workflow**:

* **SQL** for ETL and data aggregation
* **Python** for data analysis, visualization, and statistical testing
* **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and business reporting

The aim is to enable **data-driven decisions** that enhance profitability and operational efficiency.

---

## Business Problem

Retail businesses face challenges such as:

* Identifying **underperforming brands** requiring pricing or promotional adjustments
* Understanding vendor contributions to sales and profits
* Evaluating the **impact of bulk purchasing**
* Managing **slow-moving inventory**
* Statistically validating differences in vendor profitability

This project addresses these problems using structured analysis and actionable recommendations.

---

## Dataset

* Multiple CSV files stored in the `/dataset/` folder (sales, vendors, inventory,purchase)
* Summary tables generated from raw data for analysis

---

## Tools & Technologies

* **SQL:** Common Table Expressions (CTEs), Joins, Filtering
* **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy
* **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and visualizations

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Removed invalid transactions:

  * Gross Profit â‰¤ 0
  * Profit Margin â‰¤ 0
  * Sales Quantity = 0
* Created summary tables with **vendor-level metrics**
* Handled outliers, converted data types, merged lookup tables

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Negative/Zero Values Detected:**

* Gross Profit: Min -52,002.78 (loss-making sales)
* Profit Margin: Min -âˆž (sales at zero or below cost)
* Unsold inventory highlights slow-moving stock

**Outliers Identified:**

* High freight costs (up to 257K)
* Large purchase/actual prices

**Correlation Insights:**

* Weak correlation between Purchase Price & Profit
* Strong correlation between Purchase Quantity & Sales Quantity (0.999)
* Negative correlation between Profit Margin & Sales Price (-0.179)

---

## Key Insights

* **Brands for Promotions:** 198 brands with low sales but high profit margins
* **Top Vendors:** Top 10 vendors account for 65.69% of purchases â†’ risk of over-reliance
* **Bulk Purchasing:** Large orders achieve up to 72% cost savings per unit
* **Inventory Turnover:** $2.71M worth of unsold inventory indicates slow-moving stock

---

## Recommendations

* Diversify the vendor base to **reduce operational risk**
* Optimize **bulk purchasing strategies** for cost efficiency
* Reprice **slow-moving, high-margin brands**
* Strategically clear unsold inventory
* Implement targeted **marketing for underperforming vendors**
